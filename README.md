The Raw data was transformed to create a single data set in "wide form" that is consistent with the principles of Tidy data see [Hadley Wickham] (http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) 

Principles of Tidy data:
- Each variable you measure should be in one column
- Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
- There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
- If you have multiple tables,they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked

## Files

`run_analysis.R` 
- is the R Script (Recipe) for transforming the raw data into the summarised tidy data set. It reads the data from multiple files: `subject_test.txt`, `X_test.txt` and `y_test.txt`; `subject_train.txt`, `X_train.txt` and `Y_train.txt`. The data was labelled using the lableling information from `activity_labels.txt` and `features.txt` and then subsetted to use only mean() and std() features for summarization.

`SubjectActivityMeans.txt`
- is the summarized tidy data set with the Average values per Subject per Activity for the mean() and std() features.

To read in the tidy data set use `data <- read.table(file_path, header = TRUE)`

`codebook.md`
- modified code book to describe the summarized data as well as the raw data since both are inextricably linked.
